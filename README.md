## Formal Definition 
 
 10X makes sth 10 times better, 10X makes sth fail really badly if not completely)
 ultra simple and effective framework (language with term and syntax) to identify and talk about
	- key value proposition 10X and 
	- key risk factors 0X of the 10Xs

## Theories (readers could skip these parts without impairing their ability to use 10X0X framework)
	
	- Origins (10X, scientific research)
	- Perspectives of 
		- Boundaries: Upper v.s. lower, or Max v.s. min
		- Progression: Revolution v.s. Evolution
		- Value: Opportunity v.s. risks
		- Methodology: 
	- Meta: polarisation 
	- Laws (first principles) 
	- Judging criteria: 
		- Logical: 10X for real? 0X coherent to 10X?
		- Elegance:  Syntactically and ontologically simple, that comes an aesthetic problem

## Terminology and  Syntax 
10X: 10 times better than state-of-the-art, read as ten-x
0X: fail really badly if not completely, read as zero-x/o-x
10X-: some noteworthy value proposition that are not as innovative as 10X, read as ten-x-minus
0X+: some noteworthy risk factors that are not as destructive as the 0X, read as zero-x-plus/o-x-plus
1000X: a composite value proposition of three 10X, read as thousand-x
â€”0X: remove a 0X, either validated or incorrectly defined, read as remove-0X
++0X: add a OX, newly surfaced from system or missed therefore., read as add-0X

## 10X0X in action

$$ in Business Case Study domain : 
	10X for evaluating market cap derived from Market segment and product differentiation
	0X for identifying the essential risks/assumptions of the 10X propositions. What the million/billion-dollar-questions to ask?
	MVP design, Minimal Viable Product to validate the riskiest assumption, i.e., 0Xs, with the lowest cost possible.  
	Startup create 10X values to markets by continuously solving 0X with lean methodology like MVP
