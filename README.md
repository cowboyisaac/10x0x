#10x0x for 1bn people

## Definition 
 
A simple and effective framework to identify worthy pursuits and critical point of failures. 

Worthy pursuits refer to 10x value propositions and critical point of failures are the 0xs inherent to the 10x proposition.

## Usage

Yes: Fast grasping the critcal factors..

No: Quantitative analysis, evaluation of value proposition

dont resort 0x as a to-to list. it generates todo list. 
10x generate visions, 0x create actions. massive effective actions.

## Design Principles and justification 

### Choose Vigor over Rigor

10x/0x is not precisely multiplier of 10/0. Instead, they just symbolically represents and emphasize on the magnitude of the affects of your actions, that is, to make things 10 times greater or a complete failure.  

Its makes the statement forceful and vigorous and thus easier to understand and apply in every day life. 

“***Today we preach that science is not science unless it is quantitative. We substitute correlation for casual studies, and physical equations for organic reasoning. Measurements and equations are supposed to sharpen thinking but... they more often tend to make the thinking non-casual and fuzzy.  They tend to be come the object of scientific manipulation instead of auxilliary tests of crucial inference.***

***Equations and measurements are useful when and only when they are related to proof; but proof and disproof come first and is in fact strongest when it is convicing without any quantitative measurments.***

***Or to say it another way, you can catch phenomena in a logcial box or in a mathematical box. The logical box is coarse but strong. The mathematical box is fine grained by flimsy. the mathematical box is a beautiful way of wrapping up a problem, but it will not hold the phenoma unless hey have been caught in a logical box to begin with.  - John R. Platt***”

and the famous quote by John von Neumann

***"There's no sense in being precise when you don't even know what you're talking about. " -- John von Neumann***


### Minimalism: 
*"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter"*

Minimalism demands the pursuit of simplicity in defining symbols, syntaxs and common notes of 10x0x. Simplicity has been praised as a virtue of formulation of theories as in quotes of Thomas Aquinas:

***If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments where one suffices (Aquinas, Basic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, p. 129).***

Sir Isaac Newton includes a principle of parsimony as one of his three ‘Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy’ at the beginning of Book III of Principia Mathematica (1687):

***Rule I: We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.***

Albert Einstein constraints the simplicity i.e., minimizing number of axioms with the the need to maximize the number of empirical facts to cover:

***The grand aim of all science…is to cover the greatest possible number of empirical facts by logical deductions from the smallest possible number of hypotheses or axioms (Einstein, quoted in Nash 1963, p. 173).***

That also translates to an essential pillar of 10x0x framework, that is, focusing only on polarized factors leading to massive success or utter failure. In the parlance of Einstein, if I may to paraphrase his words, that would be:

***The grand aim of 10x0x is to cover the greatest possible number of critical factors leading to success or failure by logical deductions from the smallest possible number of 10xs and 0xs.***

Per the definition of simplicity in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, there are two kinds of simplicities in sight: 

1. Syntactic simplicity, a.k.a. elegance, refers to the the number and complexity of hypotheses
2. Ontological simplicity, a.k.a. Parsimony, refers to the number and complixity of things postulated. Ontological simplicity is often known as the Occam's Razor principle. 

Readers may find the trace of pursuit of minimalism throughout 10x0x, not just in design of the framewoor but also in defining laws and rules governing the usage of 10x0x. We can analogize 10x as hypothesis of value creation and 0x as the postulates behind, and judge the quality of a 10x0x proposition with both elegance and parsimony standard.

With all the strethes of minimalism here, we shall not be afraid of ongoing experimentation of new ideas for 10x0x. Always bear in mind the frist design principle of "Choose vigor over rigor"






### Laws, rules, violations of 10x0x principles.
- Law #1 no 10X without 0X. no Ox, no 10x
	- Law #2 If we remove all the factors that are likely to cause you to fail, the probability of success is higher
	- law #3 one's 0x could be other's 10x
	- having a solid 10x, must know-it-all
	- Golden Rules: 
		- Logical: 10X for real? 0Xs coherent to 10X? Path practical?
		- Elegance:  Syntactical simplicity to govern 10xs. Ontological simplicity to govern 0xs
		- mission deriding 10xs, visions embodies 10xs. 

Opearators. 1000x = trible 10x for example.

violations: 
Set the target bar too low, not qualifying a real 10x. 
0xs do not coherenlty support 10x, underestiamting the actions required. 
underestimating the 0xs

dont think of competition. Think domination only.  Dominate, set the pace

## Theories
	
	- Origins ( the 10X rule., scientific research)
	
	- Meta: polarisation, Visibility, Node and Path. 
What makes a good 10x,  focus only on how great the results coudl be 

do not be afraid of over commiting. Figure out how to live up the commitment later. even if you under perform sometimes it does not matter. You will resolve every critics with massvie sucess. 

	The obsess and only-i-can-do statement leading to 10x value proposition.
Its like a passion statement.

0x - is not to-do list, but it generate todo list based on the context.  

not just to over commit, but also take massvie action to make it increasingly more probable.
