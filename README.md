## Formal Definition 
 
	$ 10X makes sth 10 times better, 0X makes sth fail really badly if not completely)
 	$ ultra simple and effective framework (language with term and syntax) to identify and talk about
	- key value proposition 10Xs and 
	- key risk factors 0Xs of the 10Xs

## Design Principles
Good for all stage users. 1 min for beginner. Wider range of audience. Supporting potential virus growth 

## 10x0x in simple words
Critical factors leading to success or failures

| ??        | 10x           | 0x  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| ??	| winning moves| losing moves|
|?? | Define the best possible. | Cover your backs. |
| ?? | Revolutiona value proposition | Evolutions one critical risk at a time |
|??| full opportunity | greatest risks|
|??| Vision | MVP|
|??| Upper bound | Lower bound|
|??| Max | Min|


## Theories (readers could skip these parts without impairing their ability to use 10X0X framework)
	
	- Origins (10X, scientific research)
	- Perspectives of 
		- Boundaries: Upper v.s. lower, or Max v.s. min
		- Progression: Revolution v.s. Evolution
		- Value: Opportunity v.s. risks
		- Methodology: 
	- Meta: polarisation, Visibility, Node and Path. 
	- Laws: 
	- Law #1 no 10X without 0X
	- Law #2 If we remove all the factors that are likely to cause you to fail, the probability of success is higher
	- having a solid 10x, must know-it-all
	- Golden Rules: 
		- Logical: 10X for real? 0Xs coherent to 10X? Path practical?
		- Elegance:  Syntactical simplicity to govern 10xs. Ontological simplicity to govern 0xs
		- mission deriding 10xs, visions embodies 10xs. 

## Scope of applications

Yes: Fast grasping the critcal factors..

No: Quantitative analysis, evaluation of value proposition
		
## Terminology and  Syntax 

| Terms        | Meaning          | Read-as  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 10x|10 times better than state-of-the-art in some aspects | ten-x|
|0x|fail really badly if not completely | zero-x|
|10X-|some noteworthy value proposition that are not as innovative as 10X|ten-x-minus|
|0X+|some noteworthy risk factors that are not as destructive as the 0X,|zero-x-plus|
|100x|a valua proposition with double 10x | hundred-x|
|1000x| a value proposition with triple 10x | thousand-x|
|--0x| remove a 0x, eitheer validated or incorrectly identifed at the fist place| remove-0x|
|++0X| add a 0x, a newly surfaced problem or missed identifying before. | add-0x|
|..   | .. |..|



##10x0x in action 

$$ in Business Case Study domain : 

	- 10X for evaluating market cap derived from Market segment and product differentiation
	- 0X for identifying the essential risks/assumptions of the 10X propositions. What the million/billion-dollar-questions to ask?
	- MVP design, Minimal Viable Product to validate the riskiest assumption, i.e., 0Xs, with the lowest cost possible.  
	- Startup create 10X values to markets by continuously solving 0X with lean methodology like MVP
	Case studies:

## 10x0x Tools
10x0x gallery: Showcase 10x0x for crowd editing. Crowd create. 

## 10x0x canvas design
illustrate with 10x0x of 10x0x
node, path, implications, 10x for 10M
10x mutually orthogonal?? linearly uncorrelated like Principle component? Why? The benefit.
precise descition, because 10x0x all about clearly identify everything and bring to action/bias for action.
10x0x on multiple layers.
0x should lead to the direction of greatest gradient.
